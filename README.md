# TranslateRNAtoProtien

This repository is based off [fplaza's](https://github.com/fplaza/sequence-translator) repository which provides the bulk of the code. In this project me and [Casey Key](https://github.com/caseyjkey) parallelize plaza's code so it can run on multiple machines. We use both MPI and OpenMP, MPI allows us to read in large files while OpenMP allows us to speed up the computation.
